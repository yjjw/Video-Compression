# Video-Compression-System
A color video compression system with convolutional neural network.<br/>
I used a network strcture that is inspired by the famous GoogleNet. To capture the features efficiently, I applied the inception architecture to combine the outputs of two parallel convolutional processes. <br/>
Below are images for compression ratio with 1 : 2<br/>
